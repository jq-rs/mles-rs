# Contributing to Mles

As an open source project, Mles welcomes contribution from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are
thinking of helping.

## Contributions

Contributions to Mles should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. 
Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor
(someone with permission to land patches) and either landed in the main tree or
given feedback for changes that would be required. All contributions should
follow this format, even those from core contributors.

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on
the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated
efforts from contributors on the same issue.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
  
- Commits should update CHANGELOG.md according to the commit.

- Please always add unit tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature. As Mles
  is a networking protocol, not all testing can always be unit testing, thus 
  additional testing is appreciated.

## Licensing

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in Mles by you shall be licensed as MPL-2.0, without any additional 
terms or conditions. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more information.

## Conduct

In all Mles-related forums, we follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html). 

## Communication

In addition to GitHub, there is Reddit [/r/mles](http://www.reddit.com/r/mles) channel available for general discussion.
